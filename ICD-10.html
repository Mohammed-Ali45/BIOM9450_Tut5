      The International Classification of Diseases, or ICD, is a global standard
      for health related information for morbidity, mortality and its
      interpretations, but it is also a system of semantic data structuring
      that, like the soon to be discussed HL7 standards, facilitates
      interoperability of data at the epidemiological level.
      <br />
      <br />
      To implement an effective system of healthcare, the scope of diseases
      experienced by the population must be understood. That understanding must
      be well founded since it underlies all care pathways initiated, whether
      treatment or prevention. In developing an understanding of health and its
      malfunctions, accurate conclusions must be drawn from sufficiently large
      datasets from temporally and geographically distinct contexts. Further, in
      acquiring data from a vast number of sources, effort must be taken to
      ensure the data is comparable. And so the International Classification of
      Diseases aims to provide rules to healthcare providers for the collection,
      classification, processing, and presentation of health statistics. ICD is
      a collaborative effort by the World Health Organisation, and ten
      international centers, and was first implemented in 1909, but boards of
      health dedicated to the gathering and processing of continental mortality
      data date as far back as the fifteenth century. The evolution of
      healthcare throughout past centuries has led to the need to understand
      causes of mortality on a national, and sometimes, international scale.
      <br />
      <br />
      At the most basic level, ICD is a collection of categorised codes for
      causes of death and an index for diseases. ICD-10 contains more than
      <span class="Noto-Serif"> 155,000 codes in over 8,000 categories.</span>
      The evolution of the classification primarily revolves around advancement
      in medical research, with specific understanding of mortality and
      morbidity leading to a growth in the number of ways death can be
      distinguished by cause. ICD-10 consists of 3 volumes. The first volume
      includes tabular lists, inclusion and exclusion terms for cause-of-death,
      volume 2 has all the coding guidelines and rules, and volume 3 includes an
      alphabetical index of diseases.

    <p class="body-para Noto-Sans">
      The Australian Modification, ICD-10-AM, is built on the native
      classification with codes and diseases specific to Australia. There is
      also added functionality of the Austrlian Modification in interfacing with
      national healthcare and statistics organisations, like the Austrlian
      Bureau of Statistics (ABS), and the National Center for Classification in
      Health (NCCH) as well as with the Commonwealth Medicare Benefits Schedule
      for the classification of procedures.
      <br />
      <br />
      To the talk, several stakeholders and healthcare professionals concerned
      with the classification will outline their role in ensuring Australian
      mortality data is effectively collected and processed, and that the
      classification tools at hand can sufficiently distinguish all known causes
      of mortality and morbidity in Australia. The topic of the new 11th
      revision of the ICD will also be discussed, and the roadmap through the
      laborious process of updating and the potential roadmaps will be touched
      upon.
