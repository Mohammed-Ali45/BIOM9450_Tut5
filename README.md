BIOM9450 Week 4 Tutorial/Assignment for HealthCodeXWorkshop
The objective is to design a functioning and visually appealing website for a fictitious workshop purposed
to unite professionals from disciplines pertaining to health communication, messaging and classification

## directory organisation

all images are organised into subfolders based on image category (ie. icons, conference photos etc)
all pages on the website live in the root directory along with the two stylesheets being used

## typography

All fonts imported from google fonts

- Roboto Slab is used for header navigation, emphasized text in graphics, and headings.
- Noto-Serif is used for the X in the logo and emphasized text in graphics, typically italicised.
- Noto-Sans is used for body text.

## Header styling

Header height is set by the height of the logo, which is set to 80px by default. Potential issues may arise from
very high resolution screens viewing the website.

## Concerns

The entirety of this project was built using a 1080p monitor. While extensive testing was done at different zoom levels, it is unknown whether the page will display correctly or as desired on a higher or lower resolution screen.

## Color palette

Hex code bba17a was used for headings on both white and grey backgrounds, blanched almond was used for select
backgrounds, styling elements. Hex code 3b3937 was used for various backgrounds and text elements.
