                On standardising digital healthcare practices, the World
                Organisation of Family Doctors, WONZA is at the forefront when
                it comes to supplying healthcare providers with the necessary
                data to make decisions to refine primary care. There is also a
                need to classify data in a simpler, less granular manner than
                offered by the ICD standards. Representatives will, in detail,
                discuss the complex relationships between patients, primary care
                doctors, and healthcare providers at the government level and
                where they fit into the equation in an international context.

                Across several rooms in close proximity to the main hub in the
                roundhouse, there will be several skill based workshops working
                on developing competency in the ISO 11073 Standards, with a
                walkthrough of a hypothetical case of the design, manufacture,
                and deployment of an ECG machine, a device very often utilised
                in primary care medicine by various medical staff.

                At this point, there will have been a large number of talks and

                presented in the context of the workshop as a whole.
                <br />
                There will also be gifts handed out to the presenters and
                teachers that form the backbone of the workshop and make it so
                valuable.
