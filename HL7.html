      The HL7 standards represent a very important and necessary framework for
      the standardisation of health communication and information exchange on an
      international scale. The thesis centres around data interoperability,
      facilitating the secure access of relevant electronic health records when
      and where it is needed.
      <br />
      <br />
      HL7 stands for "Health Level 7". The 7 refers to the seventh layer of the
      ISO made of Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI). The standards were
      created by a not-for-profit organisation founded in 1987, Health Level 7
      International. The purpose is to standardise, and therefore make easier,
      the exchange of any healthcare related data between the myriad of computer
      systems underlying the healthcare system and its points of service. The
      standards aim to do this specifically at the application level of the OSI
      model, which is an abstraction layer that deals fundamentally with the
      input and output of data. This is to say that it is concerned with how
      information about some relevant healthcare endpoint, such as a patient's
      medication, their diagnosis, or the results of their most recent
      bloodtest, is organised, exchanged, and ultimately outputted.
      <br />
      <br />
      In mediating the way in which data is organised and exchanged, HL7 defines
      a set of messaging standards. When a specialist needs to access patient
      records to assess their health and form a care pathway, they may need to
      access information coming from several different computer systems in
      pathology, radiology, family clinic and so on. Unless all of the computers
      hosting that data speak the same language, the specialist will be unable
      to access those records and make informed decisions based on the whole
      picture. The system <span class="Noto-Serif">is not interoperable.</span>
      <br />
      <br />
      This could for example lead to a duplicated blood test or imaging
      procedure, which would cost more time and money for the healthcare
      provider, and potentially the patient as well.
    </p>

    <p class="body-para Noto-Sans">
      And so HL7, and the associated Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources
      (FHIR), tell software vendors how they should organise data so that it can
      be sent to and read by other computer systems, therefore allowing users to
      exchange information efficiently, and in the healthcare context, give
      staff the whole picture when they need it to make informed decisions about
      someone's health and wellbeing.
      <br />
      <br />
      As software and network standards evolve, so too must the messaging
      standards. Representatives from HL7 international will be talking about
      how they keep up with the rapid rate of advancement of software and
      network engineering, and how it can make healthcare systems more holistic
      in their services to patients, even as the OSI model it was originally
      based on is superseded.
